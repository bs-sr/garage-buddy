After picking up Node.js I wanted to create a simple site so that I can mess with node & express along with some other cool modules. This is just a simple app that lets users create and update ideas for their car projects.

Because this is something I made to try out node (mainly express.js) I did not focus much on the design of it, so it just uses the basic Bootstrap UI.

Here are some of the modules used for this app:
  - **bcrypt** for hashing the passwords
  - **handlebars** for templating markup
  - **mongoose** for the DB
  - **passport** for login authentication
  
I've deployed this using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and the live version can be seen [here](https://garage-buddy.herokuapp.com/)
